Welcome!

Running statistics in R, while difficult, is made even more so by the challenge of using R to manipulate data. This workshop therefore focuses on teaching the use of RStudio and the tidyverse suite of packages (e.g., ggplot2, dplyr, tidyr, etc.) to create figures and data visualizations, load, clean and summarize data, and generally troubleshoot R. Each day includes an hour for you to work on your own data, wherein you can take advantage of the instructor’s expertise to work through your own R problems and learn how to do analyses specific to your work. This workshop is geared towards raw beginners, those with a basic familiarity with R, and towards intermediate R users unfamiliar with the tidyverse suite of packages or those wanting to up their game.

This GitHub repository holds all the information relating to our workshop.

## Workshop Resources - Slides

These are the slides we'll use throughout the workshop. Answers to the activies
will be posted after the workshop.

I recommend using the html version of these
slides as they will be the most accurate with respect to formatting and will 
allow you to easily copy/paste code.

## Before the workshop


### In a nutshell... (see [below for details](#in-detail))

- [Install R](https://muug.ca/mirror/cran/)
  (**update R** to the newest version, if already installed)
- [Install RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/)
  (**update RStudio** to the newest version, if it's already installed)
- Install R packages for following along
  - `tidyverse`
  - `patchwork`
  - `palmerpenguins`
  - `skimr`
  - `janitor`
  - `readxl`
  
  To install via R commands:

  ```
  install.packages(c("tidyverse", "palmerpenguins", "skimr", "patchwork", "janitor", "readxl"))
  ```
- Consider running through the [RStudio Programming Basics Primer](https://rstudio.cloud/learn/primers/1.2)

### In detail...

**1. Install/Update R**

Even if you already have R installed, **please update it**, so we're all working with the same version.

Depending on your operating system, you can install R in one of the following ways:

Windows  

- Go to the Windows download page: <https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/>
- Download and install R for windows (the link at the top)

Mac

- Go to the Mac OS X download page: <https://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx/>
- Download and install the version that matches your Mac OS X

Linux: Debian/Ubuntu

- Specific details: <https://cran.r-project.org/bin/linux/ubuntu/README.html>
- Add one of the CRAN repositories to you apt (otherwise your R will be out of date)


**2. Install/Update RStudio**

Even if you already have RStudio installed, **please update it**, so we're all working with the same version.

- For all Operating systems (i.e., Windows, Mac Os, Linux, etc.) go to RStudio's download page:  <https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download>
- Download and install the __installer__ that matches your system (i.e. select your link from the top options, not the Zip/Tarball options)

Open RStudio ![](figures/RStudio-Ball.png){width=30px} **not R** ![](figures/R.png){width=30px}.
RStudio automatically opens R for you in the 'Console' pane

**Verify that your version of R by looking at the first line of the console (left or lower left pane), you should see something like this:**

```{r, echo = FALSE}
library(glue)

R.version |>
  glue_data(
    "{version.string} -- {nickname}",
    "Copyright (C) {year} The R Foundation for Statistical Computing",
    "Platform: x86_64-pc-linux-gnu (64-bit)",
    "",
    "R is free software and comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY.",
    "You are welcome to redistribute it under certain conditions.",
    "Type 'license()' or 'licence()' for distribution details.",
    "",
    "  Natural language support but running in an English locale",
    "",
    "R is a collaborative project with many contributors.",
    "Type 'contributors()' for more information and",
    "'citation()' on how to cite R or R packages in publications.",
    "",
    "Type 'demo()' for some demos, 'help()' for on-line help, or",
    "'help.start()' for an HTML browser interface to help.",
    "Type 'q()' to quit R.", .sep = "\n") |>
  cat()
```

The important line is the first one: `r glue("{R.version.string} -- {R.Version()$nickname}")`

**3. Install/Update Packages**

Packages are extensions or add-ons for R.
You will use many different ones over the course of your work with R. 
`tidyverse` is name of a collection of newer packages for data management. 
We will use the following packages:

- `tidyverse`
- `patchwork`
- `palmerpenguins`
- `skimr`
- `janitor`
- `readxl`

Installing/Updating these packages may take a while 
(you will see lots of download text in red in your console).
When it's finished, you should see a message similar this one to in the console (lower left hand pane)
  
```
* DONE (tidyverse)

The downloaded source packages are in
	‘/tmp/RtmpACWq9S/downloaded_packages’
> 
```
  
To install/update via R commands, type the following in the R Console

```
install.packages(c("tidyverse", "palmerpenguins", "skimr", "patchwork", "janitor", "readxl"))
```

Alternatively you can use the RStudio package manager.

- Click on the 'Packages' tab in the lower right hand corner
- Click on the 'Install' button right below the tab
- Type the name of the package (e.g., 'tidyverse') into the 'Packages' box, and click on 'Install'
- Repeat for the other packages

![](figures/A1_packages_edit.png){width=700px}


- Test that your installation had no problems by typing `library("tidyverse")` into the console and hitting enter. You should see something like this (**Note:** These are messages, not errors!):

```{r, messages = TRUE}
library("tidyverse")
```

> ### Problems?
> - If you already had R/RStudio installed, try removing them both and installing everything from scratch
> - If you get an error about a problem installing a specific package, try installing that package invidiually (search for it in the install packages menu)
> - Try installing the packages we need by hand: `dplyr`, `tidyr`, `readr`, `ggplot2`, `skimr`
> - Email Steffi <sel@steffilazerte.ca>

**4. RStudio R primers (optional)**

If you have time, please complete the [RStudio Programming Basics Primer](https://rstudio.cloud/learn/primers/1.2). 

You can complete it online and it'll give you a quick introduction to R coding which 
is will be a great way to get up to speed on the basics before we jump in.

Feel free to run through other [RStudio Primers](https://rstudio.cloud/learn/primers).



__Congratulations! Now you're ready to get into the fun stuff :)__
