Welcome!

Running statistics in R, while difficult, is made even more so by the challenge of using R to manipulate data. This workshop therefore focuses on teaching the use of RStudio and the tidyverse suite of packages (e.g., ggplot2, dplyr, tidyr, etc.) to create figures and data visualizations, load, clean and summarize data, and generally troubleshoot R. This workshop is geared towards raw beginners, those with a basic familiarity with R, and towards intermediate R users unfamiliar with the tidyverse suite of packages, or those simply wanting a refresher or a chance to dive into the details.

**Each day includes an hour for you to work on your own data, with support from 
the instructor to work through your own R problems and learn how to do analyses 
specific to your work. 
Please have work available if you would like to take advantage of this.**

This GitHub repository holds all the information relating to our workshop.

<!-- 🚧 Warning - These are 2023 slides, and 2024 slides will be updated and coming soon! 🚧 -->

These are the slides used throughout the workshop. Answers to the activities
are be posted after the workshop.

**I recommend using the html version** of these
slides as they will be the most accurate with respect to formatting and will 
allow you to easily copy/paste code and navigate

## Before the workshop - In brief

(see [below for details](#before-the-workshop---in-detail))

- Install/Update R
- Install/Update RStudio
- Install R packages for following along
  - `tidyverse`
  - `patchwork`
  - `palmerpenguins`
  - `skimr`
  - `janitor`
  - `readxl`
  
  To install via R commands:

  ```

  ```

## Before the workshop - In detail

### **1. Install/Update R**

Even if you already have R installed, **please update it**, so we're all working with the same version.

Depending on your operating system, you can install R in one of the following ways:

Windows  

- Go to the Windows download page: <https://muug.ca/mirror/cran/bin/windows/base/>
- Download and install R for windows (the link at the top)

Mac

- Go to the Mac OS X download page: <https://muug.ca/mirror/cran/bin/macosx/>
- Download and install the version that matches your Mac OS X

Linux: Debian/Ubuntu

- Specific details:
  - Ubuntu <https://muug.ca/mirror/cran/bin/linux/ubuntu/>
  - Debian <https://muug.ca/mirror/cran/bin/linux/debian/>
- Add one of the CRAN repositories to you apt (otherwise your R will be out of date)


### **2. Install/Update RStudio**

Even if you already have RStudio installed, **please update it**, so we're all working with the same version.

For all Operating systems (i.e., Windows, Mac Os, Linux, etc.) follow step 2 from RStudio's download page:  <https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download>

Open RStudio ![](figures/logo_rstudio.png){width=30px} **not R** ![](figures/logo_r.png){width=30px}.
RStudio automatically opens R for you in the 'Console' pane

**Verify your version of R by looking at the first line of the console (left or lower left pane), you should see something like this:**

```{r, echo = FALSE}
library(glue)
R.version |>
  glue_data(
    "{version.string} -- {nickname}",
    "Copyright (C) {year} The R Foundation for Statistical Computing",
    "Platform: x86_64-pc-linux-gnu (64-bit)",
    "",
    "R is free software and comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY.",
    "You are welcome to redistribute it under certain conditions.",
    "Type 'license()' or 'licence()' for distribution details.",
    "",
    "  Natural language support but running in an English locale",
    "",
    "R is a collaborative project with many contributors.",
    "Type 'contributors()' for more information and",
    "'citation()' on how to cite R or R packages in publications.",
    "",
    "Type 'demo()' for some demos, 'help()' for on-line help, or",
    "'help.start()' for an HTML browser interface to help.",
    "Type 'q()' to quit R.",
    .sep = "\n"
  ) |>
  cat()
```

The important line is the first one: `r glue("{R.version.string} -- {R.Version()$nickname}")`

### **3. Install/Update Packages**

Packages are extensions or add-ons for R.
You will use many different ones over the course of your work with R. 
`tidyverse` is name of a collection of newer packages for data management. 

We will use the following packages:

- `tidyverse`
- `patchwork`
- `palmerpenguins`
- `skimr`
- `janitor`
- `readxl`

Installing/Updating these packages may take a while 
(you will see lots of download text in red in your console).
When it's finished, you should see a message similar this one to in the console (lower left hand pane)
  
```
* DONE (tidyverse)

The downloaded source packages are in
	‘/tmp/RtmpACWq9S/downloaded_packages’
> 
```
  
To install/update via R commands, type the following in the R Console

```
install.packages(c("tidyverse", "palmerpenguins", "skimr", "patchwork", "janitor", "readxl"))
```

Alternatively you can use the RStudio package manager.

- Click on the 'Packages' tab in the lower right hand corner
- Click on the 'Install' button right below the tab
- Type the name of the package (e.g., 'tidyverse') into the 'Packages' box, and click on 'Install'
- Repeat for the other packages

![](figures/A1_packages_edit.png){width=700px fig-alt="Screenshot of the RStudio console with the Packages Tab and the Install button circled in green. A \"Install Packages\" window is open and 'tidyver' is typed into the 'Package' form field and circled in green"}


- Test that your installation had no problems by typing `library("tidyverse")` into the console and hitting enter. You should see something like this (**Note:** These are messages, not errors!):

```{r, messages = TRUE}
library("tidyverse")
```

> ### Problems?
> - If you already had R/RStudio installed, try removing them both and installing everything from scratch
> - If you get an error about a problem installing a specific package or with the `tidyverse`, try installing packages invidiually
>     - `dplyr`, `tidyr`, `readr`, `ggplot2`, `lubridate`
>     - e.g., `install.packages("dplyr")` or in the Install Packages Menu
> - Email Steffi <sel@steffilazerte.ca>

#### **4. A bit of background (optional)**

If you have time, consider reading the first couple of sections of [R for cats](https://rforcats.net/)
("Using the R console" to "lists"). 

This is a quick introduction to R coding which 
is will be a great way to get up to speed on the basics before we jump in.


__Congratulations! Now you're ready to get into the fun stuff :)__



# Use of this material for teaching

Are you an R educator? Do you want to give this workshop?

Go for it! I would love for you to adapt this material for your own use. It's licensed as GPLv3 which means you can free to copy, adapt, and use this material, but any modifications you make must also be shared under the GPLv3 licence.

Essentially if you use/adapt this material, I hope that you'll pay it forward and share with others.

I'd love to hear if you use this, how the workshop when (what worked, what didn't, and how you made changes), but that's not a requirement.
