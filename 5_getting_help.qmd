## {data-menu-title="What next?" background-image="figures/horst_knowing_so_little.png" title="Illustrated line plot of \"How much I think I know about R\" on the y-axis, and \"Time\" on the x-axis. Along the line are emoji-style faces, showing the non-linear progression of R knowledge over time. At first, a nervous face becomes a happy face early on in learning, then a \"grimace\" face at an intermediate peak before a steep decline (with an exhausted face at the local minimum). Then, a determined face charges back up a hill, reaching another peak with a \"mind blown\" face and text annotation \"join R community on twitter\" followed by another decline, but this time the faces look happy even though their \"How much I think I know about R\" value is declining."}

## Bit by bit

### Line by line

- R is sequential
- If you skip lines, you're not running that part (and R has no idea)


```{r, error = TRUE}
#a <- 1
b <- 2
a + b
```

:::{.fragment}

- Error? Start at the beginning and go line by line

```{r, message = FALSE}
a <- 1
b <- 2
a + b
```

Ah ha!

## Bit by bit

### Applies to error messages too

- First, don't panic!
- Look at the error bit by bit

```{r, echo = FALSE}
cat("Error: Problem with `summarise()` column `mean_sand`.
ℹ `mean_sand = mean(totall_sand)`.
x object 'totall_sand' not found
ℹ The error occurred in group 1: plot = \"CSP01\".")
```



## Bit by bit

### Applies to error messages too

```
Error: Problem with 'summarise()' column 'mean_sand'`
```
Okay, we know the problem is in the `summarize()` part and then `mean_sand` part of that


:::{.fragment .spacer}
```
ℹ 'mean_sand = mean(totall_sand)'
x object 'totall_sand' not found
```
Looks like this is the line with the problem.   
And the problem is `object 'totall_sand' not found`.  

**Ooops! Typo!**
:::


:::{.fragment .spacer}

```
ℹ The error occurred in group 1: plot = "CSP01".
```
Lastly, it's telling us that the problem was when working with this group of data. 

(This can be useful when troubleshooting, because you can `filter()` your data and take a look)

## Examples

### In R

```{r}
?geom_boxplot
```

> Copy and paste the examples into your console


## Examples

### On the web

- Nice to see expected output
- Helps figure out if it's your system or your code


![](figures/ggplot_examples.png){.absolute bottom=0 right=0 width=50% fig-alt="Screenshot of some examples on the ggplot2 website"}

## Web searches {.space-list}

- **Always include "R" in the search**
- **Include the package name!**
- **Use keywords**
- **Some errors are very general**

## Web searches {.space-list} 

- **Always include "R" in the search**
- **Include the package name!**
  - Try "R boxplots" vs. "R boxplots ggplot2"
- **Use keywords**
  - Try "R boxplots ggplot2 notch"
- **Some errors are very general**
  - Try "R Error: object 'm' not found"


# Stackoverflow etc.

[["R how to remove duplicate rows"](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/13967063/remove-duplicated-rows)]{.large}

## Stackoverflow etc. {.space-list}

### Things to consider

- Date (i.e., R version, Package Version)
- Packages used (`tidyverse`? R base? A mix?)
- What are the example data? 
  - `mtcars` and `iris` are commonly used data sets built into R base
  - `msleep` and `diamonds` are commonly used data sets built into `ggplot2`
- What are the example columns?
- What is actually required to answer *your* question?

## AI (specifically LLMs) ✨

### General Cautions
- Can be useful, can be painful
- Free models are so-so
- R changes fast, so AI answers can be out of date
- Own your work

![](figures/ai_meme2.jpeg){.absolute right=-5% top=10% width=45% fig-alt=""}


## AI (specifically LLMs) ✨

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column}
### Good usecases: Use AI to...
- *Support* your work, not *do* you work
- Remind yourself (enhanced search)
- Help troubleshooting
    - Rubber duck that answers back
    - Even incorrect answers can help
- Ask for suggestions for improvement
:::

::: {.column}
### Bad usecases: Do NOT use AI to...
- Create code you can't evaluate (Too soon)
- Have AI create code you don't evaluate (Too fast)
- Work with private/sensitive data

## Asking people for Help

### Not useful

- "I got an error"
- "It didn't work"

:::{.fragment}
### Better!

- "I got *this* error"
- "It didn't give me *this*"
:::

:::{.fragment}
### Best!!

- "I did *this* and I got *this* error"
- "I expected it to do *this*, but in fact the output was *this*"
:::

:::{.fragment}
### Best of the Best!!!

- "I did *this* [small reproducible code, including data set] and I got *this* [exact error/output]"
:::

## Reproducible Examples {.space-list}


- Minimal code and data required to reproduce the error
- Often preparing this actually helps you solve the error!
- Includes
  - packages (`library()`)
  - data
  - runnable code



## Reproducible Examples

### How do I change the order of `vore`?


### Not reproducible

```{r, include = FALSE}
if("tidyverse" %in% (.packages())) detach("package:tidyverse", unload = TRUE, character.only = TRUE)
if("ggplot2" %in% (.packages())) detach("package:ggplot2", unload = TRUE, character.only = TRUE)
```

```{r, error = TRUE}
ggplot(data = m, aes(x = vore, y = awake, fill = `Body Size`)) +
  theme_bw() + 
  theme(axis.title.x = element_blank()) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  scale_fill_viridis_d() +
  labs(y = "Awake time (hrs)",
       title = "Awake time by Diet")
```

- No indication of packages
- No indication of what `m` is

```{r, include = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
```


## Reproducible Examples

### How do I change the order of `vore`?

### Reproducible, but not minimal
:::{.small}
```{r}
#| code-line-numbers: "1,3-5"
#| fig-asp: 0.8
#| fig-width: 6
#| output-location: column

m <- msleep |>
  mutate(`Body Size` = if_else(bodywt > median(bodywt),

  theme(axis.title.x = element_blank()) +
